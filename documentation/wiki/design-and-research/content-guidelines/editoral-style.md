# Editoral style

### Capitalization

Simpler.Grants.gov uses sentence case in most cases. Sentence case makes content easier to scan and digest, especially in long text. It also aligns with how many people naturally speak and write, making it feel more conversational. In contrast, excessive use of title case can engender formality, making our product look stiff and unwelcoming.\
\
Sentence case examples

* H2 and lower
* Column headers
* Labels and other UI components
* Progress indicator labels
* Modal titles

Title case examples

* Page titles
* H1 headings
* The subject line for Simpler.Grants.gov newsletters
  * It follows a format where "\[Month] Updates" uses title case, while the latter portion after the pipe symbol uses sentence case. Example: "May Updates | Building momentum with every release"

Uppercase examples

* Opportunity statuses. Examples: CLOSING, OPEN.&#x20;

### Mechanics

#### Contractions

Using contractions (like _we're', it's' or you'll_) helps our writing sound more natural, approachable, and human, just like how people speak in everyday conversation. They soften overly formal language, making our content feel more friendly and accessible, especially in user-facing experiences. By using contractions, we create a tone thatâ€™s warm, relatable, and easier to connect with.
